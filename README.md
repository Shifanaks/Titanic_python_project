# Titanic_python_project

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and relationships between passenger characteristics and their survival status. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover meaningful insights.

## Dataset

- Name of the dataset - Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster

- Source - Kaggle

- Description: Contains passenger details such as:

     -Passenger ID
     
     -Survival status
     
     -Passenger class (Pclass)
     
     -Name, Sex, Age
     
     -Number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard
     
     -Ticket number and fare
     
     -Cabin
     
     -Port of embarkation (Embarked)

- Row Dataset

## Steps Performed

### Data Loading

- Imported dataset into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.

- Display the column

### Data Cleaning

- Check for the missing values

- Checked and handled missing values:

     - Filled missing Age values with mean age.

     - Filled missing Embarked values with the most frequent port.

     - Dropped or handled missing Cabin values.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Calculated summary statistics.

- Analyzed survival rates by gender, Pclass, and embarkation point.

- Checked the age distribution of survivors vs. non-survivors.

### Visualizations

- Count Plots: Survival distribution by gender, Pclass, and Sex.

- Pie Charts: Relationship between Embarked and survival status.

- Histograms: Age distribution of survivors vs. non-survivors.

## Tools & Libraries Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
